This Project is a general Framework for beaconing and beaconless graph algorithms. 
It pushes control of events to the message handlers of the nodes which inherent the logic, too.
This allows different algorithms to work together without interfering each other.

Supported beaconing algorithms are:
* Barriere
* Barriere extended
* (the backbone using one)

Supported beaconless algorithms are:
* Beaconless Forwarder Planarization
* Reactive partial Delaunay Triangulation

Supported Routing algorithms are:
* Greedy forwarding
* Face-routing
* Greedy-Face-Greedy-routing

Also it is possible to calculate:
* Unit Disk Graph
* Gabriel Graph
* partial Delaunay Triangulation
* Delaunay Triangulation
* Half-planes between two points
* Observation of the connectivity of the graph
* Angle between three points
* Circumscribed circle between two/three points
