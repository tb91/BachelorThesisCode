# This script is used to generate data samples within the reactive-spanner project in the SINALGO framework. The difference to the
# generateSamples.pl script is that for every node density a own process will be created
# The script needs three parameter in the following order: density maxDensity passes
# The values represents the following:
# * density: The start density to calculate. This will be used a corresponding number of nodes in the graph. Do not use less then 4
# * maxDensity: The maximum density to calculate
# * passes: number of passes per density
#
# Attention: Be sure SINALGO calculates the right algorithm. See the CustomGlobalBatch for this.

# using strictly defined variables only
use strict;
use warnings;
# warn user (from perspective of caller)
